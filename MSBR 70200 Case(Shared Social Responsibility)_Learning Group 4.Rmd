1. Purchasing Proporition
1.1. Flat Rate Pricing
a.
```{r}
# Null hypothesis: The proportion of purchases for FR is equal to the proportion of purchases for FR Charity.
# Alternative hypothesis: The proportion of purchases for FR is different from the proportion of purchases for FR Charity.
```
b.
```{r}
p_FR <- (77+63)/(12663+15561)
p_FRCharity <- (79+101)/(14796+15796)
z_value <- (p_FR - p_FRCharity) / sqrt(p_FR*(1-p_FR)/(12663+15561) + p_FRCharity*(1- p_FRCharity)/(14796+15796))
z_value
p_value <- pnorm(z_value, 0, 1, TRUE)*2
p_value

# The p-value is 0.1268965.
```

c.
```{r}
#Since the p-value is greater than 5%, we should not reject null hypothesis. So the proportion of purchases for FR is equal to the proportion of purchases for FR Charity.
```

1.2
a.
```{r}
# Null hypothesis: The proportion of purchases for NYOP is equal to the proportion of purchases for NYOP Charity.
# Alternative hypothesis: The proportion of purchases for NYOP is different from the proportion of purchases for NYOP Charity.
```

b.
```{r}
p_NYOP = (1137+1233)/(14077+14186)
p_NYOPCharity = (539+628+626)/(12227+13741+18117)
z_value <- (p_NYOP - p_NYOPCharity) / sqrt(p_NYOP*(1-p_NYOP)/(14077+14186) +  p_NYOPCharity*(1- p_NYOPCharity)/(12227+13741+18117))
z_value
p_value <- pnorm(z_value, 0, 1, FALSE)*2
p_value

# The p-value is 1.444616e-114.
```

c.
```{r}
#Since the p-value is smaller than 5%, we should  reject null hypothesis. So the proportion of purchases for NYOP is different from the proportion of purchases for NYOP Charity.
```


2.
a.
```{r}
# Null hypothesis: The two average unit prices under two conditions are the same.
# Alternative hypothesis: The two average unit prices under two conditions are different.
```

b.
```{r}
library(radiant)
load("~/UND/Mod 1/Intro to Statistical Analytics/Case 1/NYOP.rda")

result <- compare_means(
  dfNYOP, 
  var1 = "Condition", 
  var2 = "UnitPrice"
)
summary(result, show = FALSE)
plot(result, plots = "scatter", custom = FALSE)
```

Since the p-value is smaller than 5%, we should reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, the two average unit prices under two conditions are different. A type I error could have also been committed due to the data set not being representative of the population as all. So, we may consider that a Type I error may occur in a range that is less than 0.001.

c. 
```{r}
# Null hypothesis = The difference in the mean of the unit price for purchasing 1 photo is the same for NYOP and NYOP Charity.

# Alternative hypothesis = The difference in the mean of the unit price for purchasing 1 photo is different for NYOP and NYOP Charity.
```

```{r}
library(radiant)

## filter and sort the dataset
number_1 <- dfNYOP %>%
  filter(Number >= 1 & Number <= 1) %>%
  select(Condition:UnitPrice)
register("number_1", "NYOP")
# dtab(number_1, dec = 2, nr = 100) %>% render()

result <- compare_means(
  number_1, 
  var1 = "Condition", 
  var2 = "UnitPrice"
)
summary(result, show = FALSE)
plot(result, plots = "scatter", custom = FALSE)


```


Since the p-value is smaller than 5%, we should reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, for people that purchase 1 picture, the difference in the mean of the unit price is the different for NYOP and NYOP Charity.

d.
```{r}
# Null hypothesis = The difference in the mean of the unit price for purchasing 6 photos is the same for NYOP and NYOP Charity.

# Alternative hypothesis = The difference in the mean of the unit price for purchasing 6 photos is different for NYOP and NYOP Charity.
```

```{r}
library(radiant)

## filter and sort the dataset
number_6 <- dfNYOP %>%
  filter(Number >= 6 & Number <= 6) %>%
  select(Condition:UnitPrice)
register("number_6", "NYOP")
# dtab(number_6, dec = 2, nr = 100) %>% render()

result <- compare_means(
  number_6, 
  var1 = "Condition", 
  var2 = "UnitPrice"
)
summary(result, show = FALSE)
plot(result, plots = "scatter", custom = FALSE)
```
With the p-value of 0.288, we should not reject the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level. Therefore, the difference in the mean of the unit price for purchasing 6 photos is the same for NYOP and NYOP Charity.

# In part (a), our original ranking for the combined revenue is:

# But if we exclude the merchandise revenue and look at the photo revenue only, the new  ranking would be:
# NYOP Charity > FR > FR Charity > NYOP
# So the merchandise revenue would make a difference to the profit that the park earns.
